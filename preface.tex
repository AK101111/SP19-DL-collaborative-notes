\chapter*{Preface} \label{chp:preface}

This document aims to be a collection of lecture and laboratory notes, in an attempt to uniform the mathematical notation and gather all resources related to understand and master \emph{deep learning} in one, single location.

These notes are divided in five parts, which will constantly link to each other.
These are \fullref{prt:theory}, where the main topics will be introduced, \fullref{prt:practice}, where an intuition will be built about abstract concepts, \fullref{prt:coding}, where we'll see how to get our hands dirty with actual neural nets, on a computer, \fullref{prt:apps} where we'll encounter real life examples and applications, and \fullref{prt:papers} where short summary of the papers we've discussed will be nicely collected.
